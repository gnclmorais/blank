            A few months ago, I realised that I had reached
            <a href="https://app.getpocket.com">Pocket</a> ‚Äúbankruptcy‚Äù,
            where I found myself with almost 2000 articles to read.
            At this stage, looking at my list was more of a chore than a joy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <span class="brand">Blank.</span> project came from an attempt
            to declutter my overflowing stack of articles.
            Creating a new account was not an option for me.
            I just wanted the white space back to start again,
            more mindful of what add and what I can actually read.
          </p>

        <dt>Will you support more services?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Maybe.
            I‚Äôm interested in helping people fight their digital clutter,
            so more integrations are definitely in the roadmap.
            Tell me which ones I should be focusing on

        <dt>Why delete and not archive?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            That is cheating.
            You should only archive the articles you actually read.
